1. 'ruby-doc.org'

This is the only one I used to lookup methods for
objects. The structure of the website allowed me
to easily find what a method does, what it returns
and whether it mutates an object or not.

It also allowed me to look for alternative methods
to solve problems, since everything is listed without
obfuscation.

2. 'stackoverflow.com'

This website always helps me to get rid of any doubts
about a particular behaviour of a language and gives
great incentives to solve problems in a different manner.
