-- comments on snippet --

The error:

'Ex_5/snippet.rb:1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1) (ArgumentError)'

occurs because the method 'execute' does not take a block
of code as parameter anymore, after the method definition
was switched from 'def execute(&block)' to 'def execute(block)'.

This can be fixed by putting an '&' in front of the parameter.
