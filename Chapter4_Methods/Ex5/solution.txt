-- comments on snippet --

1) After the return keyword is commented out,
the method will print the parameter concatenated
with "!!!!", which in this case results in the output
'Yippeee!!!!'.

2) The method still returns nil, since the method
returns the return value of the 'puts' method, which
in turn always returns nil.
