-- comments on snippet --

The interpreter throws the error: 
'syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end'
because the 'end' keyword is releated to the if statement, which
in turn leaves the method definition incomplete since there is
no 'end' keyword to conclude the method.

This can be fixed by including another 'end' keyword just
before the other 'end' already present in the code.
