Comparing two different types of objects always
results in 'false'. So the code on the right of
the colon of the ternary operator is executed.
So the program executes 'puts("FALSE")' and prints
'FALSE'.

Both sides of the equality operator result 
in the number '3', and '3 == 3' results in true,
so the program executes the first 'puts' and
prints 'Did you get it right?'.

Both the second: '(x + 1) >= (y)' and the
third: '(y + 1) == x' test would evaluate to true.
But since the if statement only executes the code 
of the first check that evaluates to true and then
proceeds to execute the code after 'end', the program
only prints 'Alright now!'.'
