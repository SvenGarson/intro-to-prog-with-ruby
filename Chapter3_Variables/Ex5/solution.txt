The variable x is declared before the new block created by
passing a block of code to the times function. So x is
visible everywhere in this case.
  - output: 3
  - error:  none

-- comments on snippet_2 --

The variable y is declared before the new block created by
passing a block of code to the times function, but x is
declared inside this new block.
So x is not visible to the puts functions on the last
line, since it out of scope, and thus induces an error.
  - output: none
  - error:  'undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object (NameError)''
